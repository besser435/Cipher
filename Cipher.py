    "Encryption is poggers" -Alan Turing, probably 

    Very bad explanaion because the key and encoded message are the same
    Generate and assign a random character to a letter in a message
    The key is the alphabet in order, but with random letters
    Decoder takes key, see what letter/number/symbol is assigned to the alphabetâ€™s letter, and then decodes the message
    If I'm not mistaken, its a type of a transposition cipher.

    I'm hesitant to call it encrytion.


    Message: abcd
    key: a = g, b = 1, c = z, d = & 
    Encoded message: g1z&

    Key: g1z&
    G is in the A spot, 1 is in the B spot, z is in the C spot, & is in the D spot
    So decoded it is: abcd


    This could probably be cracked in the span of about 0.00000000001 seconds.

            Ideas:
            maybe the encoder could prefix the key with a number.
            That number would indicate how far in the key is

            Maybe generate random length caracter chunks, and randomly assign a chunk to a letter

            Combine the two
            This is awful
