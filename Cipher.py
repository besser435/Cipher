"""
NOTE
This is a very simple method I came up with, but I'm sure its already been discovered and has a proper name


Very bad explanaion considering the message is part of the key lol
Generate and assign a random character to a letter in a message
Key is the alphabet in order, but with random letters
Decoder takes key, see what letter/number/symbol is assigned to the alphabetâ€™s letter, and then decodes the message

Message: abcd
key: a = g, b = 1, c = z, d = & 
Encoded message: g1z&

Key: g1z&
G is in the a spot, 1 is in the b spot, z is in the c spot, & is in the d spot
So decoded it is: abcd


This could probably be cracked in the span of about 10 seconds.
Once you know how it works, all the data is there to decode it.
